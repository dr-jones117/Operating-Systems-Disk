/* Every file has an inode, which contains the permissions, owner,
   size, pointers to the data, etc */

#include <stdint.h>

/* The BLOCK_SIZE is specified in the superblock.  The superblock data
   structure must fit within a block, so the minimim block size is set
   to 128.  The default filesystem block size is the natural block
   size of the device that the filesystem is on, or 128, whichever is
   greater.  For testing, we use a disk image file with 128 byte
   blocks. This small block size allows us to test all of the code
   with relatively small files.

   We want the size of the inode structure to be a power of 2, so it
   fits nicely in a disk block.  We can adjust the number of direct
   blocks in order to adjust the size of the structure. */

#define NUM_DIRECT 5

/*
  For a filesystem with 128 byte blocks:
   - Five direct blocks will handle files up to 128*5 = 640 bytes.
   - Five direct and one indirect block will handle files up to 128*5
     + 128*128/4 = 4736 bytes.
   - Five direct, one indirect, and one double indirect will cover
     files up to 128*5 + 128*128/4 + 128*128/4*128/4 = 135808 bytes.
   - Five direct, one indirect, one double indirect, and one triple
     indirect will cover files up to 128*5 + 128*128/4 +
     128*128/4*128/4 + 128*128/4*128/4*128/4 = 4330112 bytes.

   For a filesystem with 256 byte blocks:
   - Five direct blocks will handle files up to 256*5 = 1280 bytes.
   - Five direct and one indirect block will handle files up to 256*5
     + 256*256/4 = 17644 bytes.
   - Five direct, one indirect, and one double indirect will cover
     files up to 256*5 + 256*256/4 + 256*256/4*256/4 = 1066220 bytes.
   - Five direct, one indirect, one double indirect, and one triple
     indirect will cover files up to 256*5 + 256*256/4 +
     256*256/4*256/4 + 256*256/4*256/4*256/4 = 68,175,084 bytes.

   A filesystem with a 4K block size can have files up to 4096*5 +
   4096*4096/4 + 4096*4096/4*4096/4 + 4096*4096/4*4096/4*4096/4 =
   4,402,345,693,184 bytes in length.  That should be enough for
   any sane person.
